    // Rich details
    overviewText: "Immerse yourself in Vaishali, a timeless crucible of democracy and ancient spirituality. Vaishali, the capital of the ancient Licchavi republic, is regarded as the world's first democratic republic. It is deeply sacred to both Buddhism—as the site where Lord Buddha preached his last sermon—and Jainism, as the holy birthplace of Lord Mahavira. Discover the meticulously designed Ashoka Pillar, capped with an iconic single-lion capital overlooking a brick stupa. We will walk past the ancient Coronation Tank (Abhishek Pushkarini), whose waters anointed local elected leaders, and climb to the serene heights of the massive Vishwa Shanti Stupa, radiating messages of peace across global contours.",
